A repsonsive website for a lifestyle blog built with Jamstack architecture. The site utilizes the Astro framework and Sanity as a headless CMS.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── logo.svg
│   │   └── logo.png
│   └── favicon.svg
│   └── profile.jpg
│   └── robots.txt
│   └── toggle-theme.js
├── src/

│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── layouts/

│   └── pages/
│   └── styles/
│   └── utils/

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.
