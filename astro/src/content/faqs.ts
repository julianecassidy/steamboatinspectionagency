        question: "Who are you?",
        answer: `I am a 30ish, single person who most days enjoys the process of living. To make things more enjoyable, I am always trying to learn new skills while also taking a slow approach to life. I like cooking and baking, traveling, gardening, crafting...basically all of the things you see on my blog! <br /> You can read more about me on the [About page](https://steamboatinspectionagency.com).`

        question: 'Why the name "Steamboat Inspection Agency"?',
        answer: `No reason, really. In college, I majored in history with a focus on transportation history. My professor mentioned during a lecture that the "Steamboat Inspection Agency" was the first government regulatory agency for transportation in the United States (it was actually called the Steamboat Inspection Service and was created in 1871).
        <br />I thought it sounded like a cool name and the URL was available, so here we are. It has made SEO and brand recognition an uphill battle though.`

        question: "Just here for the dog. Who is she?",
        answer: `Indy (officially India Bell) is the dog you most often see in my photos and videos! She was born around August 2020 and has been with me since January 2021 when I rescued her from [Moms and Mutts](https://mamcorescue.org/) in Colorado. She is part Rhodesian ridgeback and has a permanent mohawk. She is also part husky and talks all the time.
        <br />
        Her favorite things are napping in the sun, trying to catch bugs in the backyard, and hikes.
        <br />
        The other dogs you might see are Dottie Lou (the black and white one), Griff (the little brown one), and Theodore (the white and brown one).
