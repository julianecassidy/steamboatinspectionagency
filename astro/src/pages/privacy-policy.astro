      <h3>Cookies</h3>

      <p>
        If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name,
        email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so
        that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave
        another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
      </p>

      <p>

      <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>

      <p>
        Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images,
        articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the
        exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
      </p>

      <p>
        These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
        third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded
        content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content
        if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
      </p>

      <h3>Analytics</h3>

      <p>Google Analytics is integrated on this website.</p>

      <p>
        Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the
        gathering, collection and analysis of data about the behavior of
        visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service
        collects data on which website a data subject has come to a website from
        (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or
        how often and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. A web
        analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit
        analysis of Internet advertising.
      </p>

      <p>
        The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600
        Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie
        about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server
        in the USA and stored there. Google might transfer the personal
        information collected via this technical procedure to third parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        As IP anonymization is activated on our website, your IP address will be
        shortened by Google within Member States of the European Union or other
        states in agreement with the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional
        cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by a Google server
        in the USA. On behalf of the operator of the website, Google will use
        this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on
        website activity and to provide further services related to website and
        internet use to us. The IP address transferred through your browser to
        Google Analytics will not be combined with other data held by Google.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, this website uses the Analytics feature UserID to track
        interaction data. This User ID will be additionally anonymized and
        encrypted and will not be linked with other data.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at
        any time via the Internet browser or other software programs.
      </p>

      <h2>How long we retain your data</h2>

      <p>
        If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
        indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
        comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
      </p>

      <p>
        For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
        personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can
        see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
        cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and
        edit that information.
      </p>

      <h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>

      <p>
        If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can
        request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about
        you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
        that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include
        any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security
        purposes. To make a data change request, please contact the
        administrator through the contact form on this site.
      </p>

      <h2>Where we send your data</h2>

      <p>
        Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection
        service.
      </p>
